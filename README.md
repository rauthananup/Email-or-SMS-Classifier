# Email-or-SMS-Classifier
- Build an email spam classifier website with data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
- EDA is performed to understand the distribution of spam and ham messages and analyze the number of characters, words, and sentences used in the SMS.
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on spam and ham messages.
- Naive Bayes with TF-IDF vectorization and max features of 3000 performs best.
- The best performing model for spam classification is Multinomial Naive Bayes with a precision of 1.0 and accuracy of 0.9709.
- Creating and setting up Git Ignore file to exclude certain files from being pushed to GitHub.
- Writing the Flask code to load the machine learning model and create an HTML form for user inputs.
- Generated and checked requirements.txt file for libraries installation.Tested the application by inputting data and getting predictions.
- Deploying ML projects on Render through Git Hub.
- Render is a good service for deploying ML projects for free.
